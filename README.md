# Time-Series-Forecasting-ML

Executed Time Series Forecasting of Gold prices as a part of the ML project using Python. Making scientific projections based on data with historical time stamps is known as time series forecasting. It entails creating models through historical study, using them to draw conclusions and guide strategic decision-making in the future. 

Our data is separated into train and test sets using the train test split() technique. We must first separate our data into features (X) and labels (y). Divided into X train, X test, Y train, and Y test, the dataframe is. The model is trained and fitted using the X train and y train sets.    

The fact that the future result is wholly unknown at the time of the task and can only be anticipated through thorough analysis and evidence-based priors is an essential distinction in forecasting.
